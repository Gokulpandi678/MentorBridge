## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

1. The user opens the Dashboard.
2. If not logged in, the user is prompted to log in via a modal.
3. Once logged in:
   - User details are stored in context.
   - Navigation buttons become enabled.
4. The user can now:
   - View account details
   - See previous transactions
   - Make a new transaction
5. User can click **Logout**, which:
   - Resets view to home
   - Shows a toast confirming logout
